## Summary

### Drawback:
 One of the main drawbacks of this filter is that the user must know the exact dates cities or shapes to search. The filter does not allow spelling errors nor can you make any mistake in misspelling the cities even by one word.
 
 
### Recommendations

1. Add a "latest information" section that will highlight news showing recent sighting.
2. Add additional features such as a dropdown list or an helpful autofill feature.
